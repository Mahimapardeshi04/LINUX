        "1. What is Linux?\n",
        "   - Linux is an open-source operating system (OS)\n",
        "   software that manages all of the hardware and software on a computer. It’s similar to Windows or macOS, but it’s free to use, highly customizable, and especially popular among developers, system administrators, and in server environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link?\n",
        "   - **hard link**:-A Hard Link is essentially an exact copy of a file — not in the sense of copying its content, but rather it points to the same data blocks on the disk as the original file. In Linux, every file is actually just a link to something called an inode, which is a data structure that stores the file’s actual content and metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - When you create a hard link, you're creating a new filename that links to the same inode as the original file. That means the hard-linked file and the original file are indistinguishable — both are just names for the same underlying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> **softlink:**-A Soft Link, or Symbolic Link, is more like a shortcut or alias. It doesn’t point to the actual data, but rather to the filename of another file. You can easily recognize a symbolic link by the arrow notation (->) in the terminal.\n",
        "  - They can link to directories\n",
        "\n",
        "  - They can span across different file systems\n",
        "\n",
        "  - They are easier to recognize and manage for symbolic referencing\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is a Kernel in Linux?\n",
        "   - In simple terms, the kernel is the core or brain of the Linux operating system. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software, managing how the computer's resources are used.\n",
        "   - The kernel in Linux is the core component of the operating system. It’s the part of the system that directly communicates with your computer’s hardware and manages all the resources such as the CPU, memory, storage, and devices. It acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software (applications)Without the kernel, your operating system wouldn’t be able to function — applications wouldn't know how to use the hardware.\n",

        "4. How do you create a user account?\n",
        "- **Step 1:** Open the Terminal\n",
        "   - You need sudo (administrator) privileges to create users.\n",
        "- **Step 2:** Use the adduser or useradd Command\n",
        "  - There are two main commands for adding users:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - adduser (preferred for being user-friendly)\n",
        "\n",
        "   - useradd (more low-level, requires more options)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the ‘grep’ command used for in Linux?\n",
        " - The grep command in Linux is used to search for specific patterns or text within files or input. It's one of the most powerful and commonly used text-processing tools in Unix/Linux\n",
        " -Basic Usage:\n",
